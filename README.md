# OCT-DANN Analysis and 3D Visualization

This project optimises a Domain-Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) to analyze OCT images and predict plaque types in vessels. The project includes an interactive 3D visualization tool that maps these predictions onto a 3D model of the vessel.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hatem2040/OCT-DANN-.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd OCT-DANN-
    ```


## Project Structure
- `OCT-DANN_Deploy_.ipynb`: The main notebook containing the analysis and visualizations.
- `models/`: Directory where trained models and logs are stored.
- `visualizations/`: Contains the saved 3D plots and figures generated by the notebook.

## Results
The DANN model achieved a high accuracy in predicting plaque types. The 3D visualizations provide a clear representation of the plaque distribution along the vessel. Below is an example of the visualization:
